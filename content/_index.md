I am a dedicated Software Developer with 3+ years of experience and a diverse skill set.
I have a solid understanding of technologies such as C, C++, C# and .NET.
Iâ€™m proficient with Godot and Unity, and I'm interested in learning Odin, Zig and Rust, too.

Known for being proactive, honest, and direct, I excel in decision-making and have a keen attention to detail, especially in technical aspects. My primary areas of interest include Systems Programming (high-performance, low-latency applications such as Operating Systems and Game Engines) and Cyber Security (Reverse Engineering and Penetration Testing).

I daily drive Bazzite Linux, a custom image built upon Fedora Atomic Desktops. My enthusiasm for technology extends to Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) and Open-Source Hardware (OSH). Driven by a desire for excellence, I am commited to continue evolving as a developer.
